### Favorite CPSC 120l Labs

* Lab 3 part 1 was a favorite because we were able to make a program to calculate your basal metabolic rate. This was one of my favorite labs because I liked how we applied math within our program to calculate this. Through this lab, I learned how to write function definitions and call them effectively in my code.

* Lab 4 part 1 was another favorite because we were able to make a unit conversion program. This lab was one of my favorites because it demonstrates how programming connects to real-world use. I liked that this lab taught me how a simple task like converting units can broken down and automated through programming.

* Lab 9 part 1 was another favorite because we were able to make a spell checker. This lab was one of my favorites because it demonstrated how a simple spell-checking program works. Through this lab, I learned how to read data from files and compare them to check for misspelled words.
